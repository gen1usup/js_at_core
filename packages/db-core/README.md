# @automation-platform/db-core

## Purpose

PostgreSQL client primitives for DB-backed checks.

## Scope

- Provides the public API listed below.
- Stays focused on its package responsibility inside the automation starter kit.
- Is designed to be composed with other packages instead of owning complete scenarios alone.

## Non-goals

- Does not replace a test runner.
- Does not introduce project-specific business logic.
- Does not claim production readiness beyond the tests and CI in this repository.

## Public API

- dbConfigSchema
- DbConfig
- PostgresDatabaseClient

## Basic usage

```ts
import { dbConfigSchema } from '@automation-platform/db-core';

const exists = await db.exists('select 1 from users where id = $1', [userId]);
```

## Integration

- Used through workspace imports by tests, examples or neighboring packages.
- Prefer depending on shared contracts when crossing package boundaries.
- See the root README showcase matrix for concrete usage paths.

## Configuration

- Most options are passed explicitly by constructor/function input.
- Environment-level settings are handled by @automation-platform/config when needed.
- This package does not require secrets directly unless the caller passes them into its own config.

## Error handling

- Errors are surfaced to callers instead of being swallowed.
- Shared platform error classes from @automation-platform/utils are used where this package owns the failure mode.
- Callers should add scenario-level diagnostics/cleanup through execution and diagnostics packages.

## Testing

typecheck and mock DB showcase only; no real PostgreSQL CI test

## Limitations

PostgreSQL only; demo app uses JSON files, not this package.

## Extension points

- Extend by adding narrow functions/classes with tests.
- Keep app-specific behavior in projects/\* unless it is truly reusable.
- Avoid broad abstractions until at least two real scenarios need them.
